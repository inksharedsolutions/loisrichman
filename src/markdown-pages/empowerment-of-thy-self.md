Life itself depends on EMPOWERMENT OF THE SELF without violence or retaliation to another.

You must first walk in love and trust that you are being led to find your own peace, your own truth, and a life that goes beyond your highest expectations whether it is in your home life or in your career.

You must work at discovering this truth. Accept the results and changes whether arriving where you wish. This can take a day, a month, a year, or even the rest of your life! If you are looking for peace and happiness and fulfillment already inside of you, with an effort expended by you and not someone else leading the way for you to clear the branches so to speak, the falls, or the turn-around, whether it be childhood harm, the lack of money or your oh-so valuable self-esteem, it is by making these choices under your own power and correcting these choices, mistakes, and wrong turns that you will increase your faith and believe so strongly in yourself that the result will be finding the pure joy that already surrounds you.

In other words, YOU will be on your own hero's journey as through this effort, you have become your own hero!
